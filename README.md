# Project-551
Overview
This project introduces an advanced emulation-based system for distributed file storage and parallel computation, uniquely designed to work with both SQL and NoSQL database systems. 
It leverages partition-based map and reduce methodologies to enhance search and analytics functions within distributed environments.

Key Features
Distributed File Storage & Parallel Computation: Implements a distributed system for storing data across multiple nodes, enabling parallel data processing for increased efficiency and scalability.
Map & Reduce with SQL and NoSQL Databases: Utilizes a partition-based map and reduce approach, adeptly configured for both SQL (e.g., MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., Firebase) databases, optimizing search and analytics capabilities.
User-Intuitive Application: A user-friendly application built using Python scripts and Flask, providing seamless interaction with Firebase and MySQL databases.
Comprehensive CRUD Operations: Incorporates Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through the web-application, facilitating effective data management.
Enhanced Data Querying Features: Offers advanced data querying functionalities, including real-time retrieval, filtering, joins (for SQL databases), and sorting, to streamline data analysis.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS.
Databases: Firebase (NoSQL), MySQL (SQL)
